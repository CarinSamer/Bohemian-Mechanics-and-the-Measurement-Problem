# Bohmian Mechanics and the Measurement Problem  

![Research Poster](Mayer Group Research Poster.jpeg)

## 📖 About This Project  
This research paper was developed as part of the **"Introduction to Quantum Research for Girls"** program—a **9-week initiative** offered by [PhysicsBeyond](https://physicsbeyond.com/) and [Girls in Quantum](https://www.girlsinquantum.com/).  

The project was conducted during the course phase with the guidance of the **Mayer team**, consisting of:  
- **Farheen**  
- **Carin Samer**  
- **Prayanshi Garg**  
- **Menna Mohammed**  
- **Afreen Hossam**  

## 🧑‍🔬 Research Focus  
Our research explores **Bohmian Mechanics**, a deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics, and its potential to resolve the **measurement problem**.  

## 📌 Acknowledgments  
We extend our gratitude to **PhysicsBeyond** and **Girls in Quantum** for organizing this insightful program and providing us with the opportunity to delve into quantum research.
